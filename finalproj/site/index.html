  <h2>Math 251 Project Presentation</h2>
  <p>Slope of a secant lines for a data set compared to the derivative of a regression of the data set</p>

  <!-- <h2>Introduction 25%</h2>
  <p>Clear description of the topic and data including units/scale. How it was chosen and a clear and compelling description of why it was chosen.</p> -->

  <p>This project examines Oregon home pricing data from <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fhfa-house-price-indexes-hpis">data.gov</a>. I chose this topic because my wife and I want to buy a house sometime. Ideally we want to buy when prices are
    at a local minima. Perhaps this dataset will provide some useful insight.</p>

  <p>I've arranged the data such that the x axis represents year, and the y axis represents average house price in thousands.</p>

  <!-- <h2>Presentation of Data 25%</h2>
  <p>Data is presented in table and graphic form following the Writing Guidelines including appropriate scales/column headings, units and fig. reference notation. Slope of secant line correctly found for at least one point.</p> -->

  <!-- <h2>Regression 25%</h2>
  <p>Several regressions of the data were correctly performed and are presented. Logical and complete reasons for best choice are given including long- and short-run behavior and limitations.</p> -->

  <!-- <h2>Conclusion 25%</h2>
  <p>Results of data and regression calculations correctly interpreted. Shortcoming of the method are addressed and limitations of choices discussed.</p> -->

  <!-- <p>Grade Calculated (Max is 95% plus up to 5pts for Wow! Points) using the following formula: 50 + 3.75*(Intro+Data+Domain+Incresaing)+WowPoints</p> -->
